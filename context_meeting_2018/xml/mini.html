    <p>All the leading web browsers, except for Google Chrome, include a separate “reading mode” that extracts the main content from pages, reformats it to be more readable, and hides distractions like advertisements, comments, and even page navigation. This separate rendering mode isn’t governed by any standards and as such it behave differently from web browser to web browser. So what is a web developer to do to properly support this distinctly separate and non-standard rendering mode?</p>

        <strong>The non-standard rendering mode</strong>

        The history of reading mode, a look at the different parsers we have today and how they came to be, and a small criticism of the Apache 2.0 license.

        <br/>
        There are many approaches to content-analysis and extraction, and most only work well with English-content. Why is reader mode so slow to activate, anyway?

        Visual page inspections, standard metadata, or guesswork? Everyone has their own ideas about how to best determine the metadata describing an article.

        Encourage publishers to fix their designs, and standardize reading mode now.
